# Calculator

This is a solution to the [Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) challenge. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a platform to to help people learn to code for free.

## Overview

### The challenge

Build a functional calculator using JavaScript and a front-end framework. The user should be able to:
- Add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when they hit =, the correct result should be shown
- When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros
- Perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- A little bit of Bootstrap
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### How to run this project locally

#### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
```npm install``` 

then

```npm start```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### What I learned

The logic for this project was challenging, but I tried to come up with my own solution and keep my code as clean as I could. I used class based components and I feel I really learned a lot about how React works after this project.

### Continued development

Although I learned a lot with this project, I would like to redo it using React hooks in the future. I would also like to add a feature that I noticed almost all calculators have these days, which makes it easier to use %. For example, take ```100 - 10%```. My calculator would show ```99.9``` as 10% alone is 0.1, whereas a smartphone calculator usually deducts that the user wants to know what 100 minus 10% of 100 is and shows ```90``` as a result.
